    "Hey! I'm Adam, a full stack engineer currently working for JP Morgan in London, UK. Most of my experience lies in designing sleek backend microservices, but I also develop clean and responsive websites when I get time.",
    "I graduated from the University of Southampton with a Bachelors of Engineering back in 2017, and kick started my career in technology on the Amex graduate program.",
    "I taught myself Java from the age of 15 and was heavily involved in the Minecraft open source community for over 5 years. During this time I developed bespoke software for many of the leading server networks, and that experience gave me the skills I needed to help bootstrap my career in technology.",
    "Below you will find a summary of my technical skills, my work experience and some of the exciting projects I've been a part of!"
